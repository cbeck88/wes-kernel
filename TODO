-- EVENT layout:
-- { 
--	name
--	id
--	conditional
--	action
-- }

-- Events is a TABLE of ARRAYS, indexed by NAME

-- MENU_ITEM layout:
-- { 
--	id
--	show_if
--	conditional
--	action
-- }

-- kernel.wml_menu_items is a TABLE indexed by id

-- Variables is a TABLE of string | numeric | table. Meant to be backwards compatible with wesnoth 1 and used for variable substitution

-- Labels is a TABLE, representing a map: map_location -> { string text, int player, bool share }

-- Villages is a TABLE, representing a map: map_location -> { int owner | 0 for none }

-- Map is a USERDATA, can use get_terrain(map_location)

-- Units is a USERDATA, can use get(map_location) or get(id), and can "put" which is like unstore
-- Units is a big heavy lifter -- pushing units is what updates the vision data structures
-- Make units with Unit(...) or LuaUnit(...)
-- Units are USERDATA also, being bound to custom objects somehow

-- Sides is a TABLE, usable as an array but with some custom functions for Allied With 
-- A side is userdata but is basically static table data typically.
-- Sides contain FOG and SHROUD override data, stored essentially as a map_location -> optional bool table. (But it's really userdata.)
-- They contain "proxy shroud data" for "true" vision and "adjusted" vision of both kinds.
-- Under Sides[k].Vision

-- Pathing is a table of functions to find distances, directions, and shortest paths
-- And get adjacent locations
-- (Topology?)

-- TimeOfDay.Schedule is the current (default) TOD schedule
-- TimeOfDay.TimeAreas is the array of registered time areas entries
